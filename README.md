Deep Learning: The non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup wants to create an algorithm to predict whether or not applicants for funding will be successful.

## Overview:

This project uses Jupyter Notebook files that build, train, test and optimize a deep neural network that models charity success from nine features in a loan application data set.  From this dataset, I utalized the features to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
